# Caesar cipher 

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
The algorithm takes a message stored in a string and shifts every letter a given number of steps in the alphabet. 
For example a caesar cipher with a shift of 1 and "ABC" as an input would output "BCD". If the range of the alphabet is exceeded
the algorithm starts in the beginning of the alphabet.
As an exercise I implemented it in Java.
